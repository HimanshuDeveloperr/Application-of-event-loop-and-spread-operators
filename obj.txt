  what is spread operators?

 it basically gives us the new array/objects with same value as previously defined

 let obj ={
    key 1:value1,
    key 2:value 2
 }

 let obj2= {...obj1}

 console.log(obj2)

 it will give us {key1: 'value1', key2: 'value2'}

 due to our spread (...)operator in es6 which help us to build new obj here with same key and value pair.
 note value also are same.
